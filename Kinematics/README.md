# Robotic Arm: Pick and Place (`Kinematics`)

Use knowledge of kinematics and ROS to manipulate a robotic arm in simulation with six degrees of freedom to pick up an object from one location and place it in another without running into obstacles.

Pros:<br>* Can have very high positional accuracy<br>* Large payloads (gantry)*<br>Simplest control strategy since there are no rotational movements<br>* Very stiff structure<br>Cons:<br>* All the fixtures and associated equipment must lie within its workspace<br>* Requires large operating volume<br>Typical Applications:<br>* Palletizing<br>* Heavy assembly operations (e.g., cars and airplane fuselage) | | | |
    

## Kinematic Analysis

#### 1. Run the forward_kinematics demo and evaluate the kr210.urdf.xacro file to perform kinematic analysis of Kuka KR210 robot and derive its DH parameters.

a DH parameter table with proper notations and description; 
a annotated figure of the robot with proper link assignments and joint rotations 

Here's | A | Snappy | Table
--- | --- | --- | ---
1 | `highlight` | **bold** | 7.41
2 | a | b | c
3 | *italic* | text | 403
4 | 2 | 3 | abcd


#### 2. Using the DH parameter table derived earlier, create individual transformation matrices about each joint. In addition, also generate a generalized homogeneous transform between base_link and gripper_link using only end-effector(gripper) pose.

a homogeneous transform matrix from base_link to gripper_link using only the position and orientation of the gripper_link;


#### 3. Decouple Inverse Kinematics problem into Inverse Position Kinematics and Inverse Orientation Kinematics; doing so derive the equations to calculate all individual joint angles.

breakdown the IK problem into Position and Orientation problems, derive the equations for individual joint angles

## Implementation

* `IK_server.py` - 

Calculate and plot the error in end-effector pose generated by joint angle commands. You can do this by calculating end-effector poses via Forward Kinematics using your code output (which is a set of joint angles) and comparing it with the end-effector poses you received as input.
