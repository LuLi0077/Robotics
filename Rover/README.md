# Search and Sample Return

![rover](images/rover.jpg)

Program a space rover to search for environmental samples in a simulated environment using computer vision techniques, including the three main steps in the robotics process: perception, decision making, and actuation. This project is modeled after the [NASA sample return challenge](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/centennial_challenges/sample_return_robot/index.html).
